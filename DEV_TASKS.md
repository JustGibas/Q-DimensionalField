# Development Tasks & Issues

## Current Tasks
- Finalize and debug the base chunk generation system.
- Ensure reliable triggering of chunk creation via VR controllers and keyboard.
- Validate consistent world rendering and scene loading.

## Next Tasks
- Refine the logic for chunk variation and placement.
- Integrate advanced error handling and UI feedback for user interactions.
- Optimize performance when dynamically expanding the world.

## Known Issues & Challenges
- Occasional misalignment between generated chunk positions and rendered scene.
- Performance bottlenecks with rapid chunk creation.
- Variability in VR controller event behavior across devices.

## Future Considerations
- Expand to support multidimensional chunk generation.
- Investigate procedural algorithms for complex world expansion.
- Evaluate potential integration with AI-driven texture and asset generation.
