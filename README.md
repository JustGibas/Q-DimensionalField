1 rust based wasm and webgpu, vite, vercel.
2 Vr Ar Xr game like voxel chunks that run as global server. 
3 each voxel acts as server. 
4 user interact with voxels clone.
5 voxels comunicate thrue events.
6 voxels comunicate only with nabouring voxels
7 xyz 0:0:0 voxel is in starting point and extend 5 units in all direction making it 10 yint size voxel
Ideas from brainstorming
Basic project structure
WebGPU setup
Voxel server setup
Hybrid communication approach
Microservices with Wasm
