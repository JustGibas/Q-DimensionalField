# VR Exploration Game Development Plan

## Overview
The VR Exploration Game is an open-world experience built using A-Frame, Taichi.js, and a dynamic voxel chunk system. Hosted on GitHub Pages, the game offers an immersive VR/AR/XR experience with procedurally generated worlds.

## Features & Requirements
- **Open World Architecture:**
  - World divided into chunks generated on demand.
  - Chunks with multiple variations (e.g., color, material) that can later evolve into multidimensional representations.
- **Player Interaction:**
  - VR controllers and keyboard support for navigation and chunk creation.
  - Real-time feedback and dynamic world expansion.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Built with A-Frame for scene management.
  - Uses Three.js for mesh generation (imported via modules).
  - Taichi.js for computation/simulation tasks when needed.
  - Highly modular structure with separate components for chunks, player controls, and world management.

## Development Phases & Milestones
1. **Prototype (Alpha)**
   - Set up a basic VR scene with player rig and environment.
   - Implement foundational chunk generation with randomized variations.
   - Enable basic interaction for new chunk creation.
2. **Feature Expansion (Beta)**
   - Refine chunk generation logic with improved algorithms and error handling.
   - Enhance VR controller and keyboard interactions.
   - Expand the range of chunk types and visual effects.
3. **Polish & Release (Production)**
   - Optimize performance and resource management.
   - Finalize testing and add comprehensive documentation.
   - Deploy on GitHub Pages and gather user feedback.

## Roadmap
- **Short-Term:** Complete core chunk functionality and player interaction.
- **Mid-Term:** Integrate advanced variations, UI feedback, and error logging.
- **Long-Term:** Support multidimensional expansion and AI-driven texture/asset generation.

## Developer Setup & Resources
- **Code Structure:** Modular components (e.g., `voxel-chunk`, `player-controls`, `chunk-manager`).
- **Requirements:** Modern WebVR-capable browser and local HTTP server for module support.
- **References:** A-Frame, Three.js, and Taichi.js documentation.
