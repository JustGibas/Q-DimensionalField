## Current Implementation (0.0.2)
### Focus Areas
1. Window Management
   ```javascript
   // Core window functionality
   class WindowManager {
     windows: Map<string, UIWindow>
     activeWindows: Set<string>
     zIndexCounter: number
   }
   ```

2. Event System
   ```javascript
   // Event handling
   class UIEventSystem {
     listeners: Map<string, Set<Function>>
     dispatch(event: string, data: any)
     subscribe(event: string, callback: Function)
   }
   ```

3. Debug Interface
   ```javascript
   // Debug HUD
   class DebugHUD {
     metrics: Map<string, any>
     updateInterval: number
     displayMode: 'minimal' | 'full'
   }
   ```

### Testing Checklist
1. Window System:
   - [ ] Window creation
   - [ ] Dragging
   - [ ] Z-index management
   - [ ] State persistence

2. Event System:
   - [ ] Event propagation
   - [ ] Performance monitoring
   - [ ] Error handling

3. Debug Interface:
   - [ ] FPS counter
   - [ ] Memory usage
   - [ ] World statistics

### Success Criteria
- All windows properly respond to user interaction
- No event system memory leaks
- Debug HUD updates at 60fps
- Clean error logs

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic window system
2. Setup event management
3. Create debug overlay
4. Test UI responsiveness

## Development Notes
### Current Focus
- UI Framework implementation
- Event system optimization
- Performance monitoring

### Known Issues
- HTTPS warning (can be ignored for development)
- Touch controls need passive listeners

### Performance Targets
- UI updates: < 16ms
- Event handling: < 5ms
- Window operations: < 10ms

## Version Control System
- Major: Breaking changes/Complete features
- Minor: New features/Substantial improvements
- Patch: Bug fixes/Small improvements

### Version Progress
- [x] 0.0.1 - Initial Logging System
- [ ] 0.0.2 - Core Systems Implementation
- [ ] 0.0.3 - Basic World Generation
- [ ] 0.1.0 - First Stable Feature Set

## Development Testing Protocol

### Automated Testing (via Actiona)
1. Console Logging Verification
   - Location: `/console-log/LastIterConsole.log` and `/console-log/LastIterConsoleErrors.log`
   - Purpose: Track system events and flow
   - Success Criteria: No unexpected errors/warnings

2. User Input Testing
   - Location: `/console-log/LastIterConsoleTestes.log` (will be umplemented later in development)
   - Managed by: Actiona script
   - Test Cases:
     - Basic Movement (WASD)
     - UI Interactions
     - System Events

3. Manual Verification
   - Final check by JG
   - Performance metrics review
   - Gameplay experience assessment

### Current Iteration Goals (0.0.1)
- [x] Implement comprehensive logging system
- [x] Set up version tracking
- [x] Create automated test framework
- [ ] Verify logging output format
- [ ] Test logging performance impact

### Next Iteration Goals (0.0.2)
- [ ] Basic chunk generation
- [ ] Player movement system
- [ ] Initial UI framework
- [ ] World state management

## Testing Requirements

### Console Log Verification
Required log entries for 0.0.1:

### Instructions for JG to Test
is ui woking?

### JH obseravtions

i been developing with this stak a few days and i now find a new pop up mesge that was not here before:
Access this site over HTTPS to enter VR mode and grant access to the device sensors.

### Solutions and resoning earea.

the warning about HTPPS can be ignored it will work fine when deployed.

add an tsk to plan to rework readme human input patrt to by finished.
