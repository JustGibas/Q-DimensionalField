# VR Exploration Game Development Plan

## Overview
The VR Exploration Game is an open-world experience built using A-Frame, Taichi.js, and a dynamic voxel chunk system. Hosted on GitHub Pages, the game offers an immersive VR/AR/XR experience with procedurally generated worlds.

## Features & Requirements
- **Open World Architecture:**
  - World divided into chunks generated on demand.
  - Chunks with multiple variations (e.g., color, material) that can later evolve into multidimensional representations.
- **Player Interaction:**
  - VR controllers and keyboard support for navigation and chunk creation.
  - Real-time feedback and dynamic world expansion.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Built with A-Frame for scene management.
  - Uses Three.js for mesh generation (imported via modules).
  - Taichi.js for computation/simulation tasks when needed.
  - Highly modular structure with separate components for chunks, player controls, and world management.

## Logging Improvements

### Overview
Logging has been improved across all parts of the game to provide detailed insights into the game's flow and operations. This includes extensive explanations for each logging statement and a flag to enable or disable logging.

### Logging Flag
A logging flag has been added to enable or disable logging. This flag can be found in the script section of `index.html` and in the `init` functions of various components.

### Enabling/Disabling Logging
To enable logging, set the `loggingEnabled` flag to `true`. To disable logging, set the flag to `false`.

### Examples of Logging Output
- Initialization of the A-Frame scene: `console.log('A-Frame scene loaded')`
- Loading of the world container: `console.log('World container status:', { childCount: container.children.length, children: Array.from(container.children).map(c => c.getAttribute('chunk')) })`
- Player rig setup: `console.log('Player rig setup complete')`

### Purpose of Logging
The purpose of logging is to provide developers with detailed insights into the game's flow and operations. This helps in debugging and understanding the game's behavior, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
