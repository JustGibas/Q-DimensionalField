### Architecture

#### Core Components
```
World
├── Chunks (10x10x10)
│   ├── Blocks (1x1x1)
│   └── Voxels (0.1³)
└── Managers
    ├── ChunkManager
    ├── TextureManager
    └── WorldManager
```

#### Implementation Details
- **Save System:**
  - Chunks: RGB-encoded height maps
  - World: Compressed binary data
  - Voxels: Run-length encoding

## Development Phases

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Implement RGB terrain encoding
- Test texture baking performance
- Optimize chunk generation

### Phase 2
- Enhance compression systems
- Implement proper LOD
- Add advanced culling

### Phase 3
- Polish visualization
- Optimize memory usage
- Deploy beta version

## Technical Notes

### RGB Encoding System
```javascript
// Example encoding structure
{
  red: heightData,    // 0-255 for height
  green: typeData,    // 0-255 for block types
  blue: variantData,  // 0-255 for variations
  alpha: metaData     // Additional information
}
```

### Development Setup
- Modern WebVR browser required
- Local HTTP server for module support
- Node.js for build tools

## Logging Improvements

### Overview
Logging has been improved across all parts of the game to provide detailed insights into the game's flow and operations. This includes extensive explanations for each logging statement and a flag to enable or disable logging.

### Logging Flag
A logging flag has been added to enable or disable logging. This flag can be found in the script section of `index.html` and in the `init` functions of various components.

### Enabling/Disabling Logging
To enable logging, set the `loggingEnabled` flag to `true`. To disable logging, set the flag to `false`.

### Examples of Logging Output
- Initialization of the A-Frame scene: `console.log('A-Frame scene loaded')`
- Loading of the world container: `console.log('World container status:', { childCount: container.children.length, children: Array.from(container.children).map(c => c.getAttribute('chunk')) })`
- Player rig setup: `console.log('Player rig setup complete')`

### Purpose of Logging
The purpose of logging is to provide developers with detailed insights into the game's flow and operations. This helps in debugging and understanding the game's behavior, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

## Inventory Ideas

### Overview
The inventory system will allow players to collect, store, and manage various items within the game. This includes resources, tools, and other objects that can be used for crafting, building, and exploration.

### Features
- **Item Collection:**
  - Players can collect items by interacting with the environment.
  - Items can be picked up, dropped, and transferred between inventory slots.
- **Inventory Slots:**
  - The inventory will have a limited number of slots for storing items.
  - Each slot can hold a specific type and quantity of item.
- **Crafting System:**
  - Players can combine items to create new tools, structures, and resources.
  - Crafting recipes will be available for players to discover and use.
- **Resource Management:**
  - Players must manage their resources effectively to survive and progress in the game.
  - Resources can be gathered from the environment and used for crafting and building.

### Implementation Details
- **UI Design:**
  - The inventory UI will be accessible through a menu or hotkey.
  - Items will be displayed in a grid layout with icons and descriptions.
- **Item Types:**
  - Common items: wood, stone, metal, food, etc.
  - Tools: pickaxe, axe, shovel, etc.
  - Special items: rare resources, unique tools, etc.
- **Interaction:**
  - Players can interact with the inventory using VR controllers or keyboard/mouse.
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for moving items between slots.
- **Persistence:**
  - Inventory data will be saved and loaded with the player's progress.
  - Items will be retained between game sessions.

### Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Crafting:**
  - More complex crafting recipes and item combinations.
  - Integration with the world generation system for unique resources.
- **Inventory Expansion:**
  - Additional inventory slots and storage options.
  - Backpacks, chests, and other storage containers.
- **Multiplayer Support:**
  - Shared inventory and trading between players.
  - Cooperative crafting and resource management.
