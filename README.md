# VoxelSpace

## Project Overview

VoxelSpace is a VR/AR/XR game that uses voxel chunks to create a global server. Each voxel acts as a server, and users interact with voxel clones. Voxels communicate through events and only with neighboring voxels. The starting point is at coordinates (0, 0, 0), and each voxel extends 5 units in all directions, making it a 10-unit size voxel.

Vue.js is now integrated into the project for frontend development. üñ•Ô∏è

## Project Structure

The project has a clear directory structure with separate directories for Rust code, WebGPU setup, and Wasm modules:

- `src`: Contains the main Rust code for the voxel server and game logic.
- `web`: Contains the WebGPU setup and any frontend code.
- `wasm`: Contains the Wasm modules and related code.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JustGibas/VoxelSpace.git
   cd VoxelSpace
   ```

2. Install Rust and WebAssembly target:
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. Serve the project locally (e.g., using Vite):
   ```sh
   npm install -g vite
   vite
   ```

5. Install Deno:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
   ```

6. Run the project using Deno:
   ```sh
   deno run --allow-net --allow-read web/main.js
   ```

7. Install Vite:
   ```sh
   npm install -g vite
   ```

8. Run the project using Vite:
   ```sh
   vite
   ```

9. Deploy the project on Vercel:
   - Create a `vercel.json` file in the root directory with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "builds": [
         { "src": "web/main.js", "use": "@vercel/node" }
       ],
       "routes": [
         { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "web/main.js" }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Install Vercel CLI:
     ```sh
     npm install -g vercel
     ```
   - Deploy the project:
     ```sh
     vercel
     ```

10. Install Vue.js:
    - Add a script tag to include Vue.js from a CDN in `web/index.html`:
      ```html
      <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2"></script>
      ```

11. Initialize Vue.js app:
    - Create a `div` element with `id="app"` in `web/index.html`:
      ```html
      <div id="app"></div>
      ```

    - Initialize a Vue.js app in `web/main.js`:
      ```javascript
      new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        data: {
          message: 'Hello Vue!'
        }
      });
      ```

## Event-Driven Architecture and Microservices

The project uses an event-driven architecture and microservices approach to ensure modularity and scalability. Each voxel acts as a server, handling its own state and communication with neighboring voxels. The communication is event-driven, allowing for real-time updates and interactions.

### Microservices with Wasm

Microservices are implemented using Wasm modules in the `wasm` directory. Each microservice handles a specific aspect of the game, such as physics, AI, or user interactions. The event-driven architecture allows microservices to communicate with the main voxel server and other microservices by subscribing to relevant events and publishing events as needed.
