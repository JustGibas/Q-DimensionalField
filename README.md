# VoxelSpace

## Project Overview

VoxelSpace is a VR/AR/XR game that uses voxel chunks to create a global server. Each voxel acts as a server, and users interact with voxel clones. Voxels communicate through events and only with neighboring voxels. The starting point is at coordinates (0, 0, 0), and each voxel extends 5 units in all directions, making it a 10-unit size voxel.

Vue.js is now integrated into the project for frontend development. üñ•Ô∏è

## Project Structure

The project has a clear directory structure with separate directories for Rust code, WebGPU setup, and Wasm modules:

- `src`: Contains the main Rust code for the voxel server and game logic.
- `web`: Contains the WebGPU setup and any frontend code.
- `wasm`: Contains the Wasm modules and related code.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JustGibas/VoxelSpace.git
   cd VoxelSpace
   ```

2. Install Rust and WebAssembly target:
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. Serve the project locally (e.g., using Vite):
   ```sh
   npm install -g vite
   vite
   ```

5. Install Deno:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
   ```

6. Run the project using Deno:
   ```sh
   deno run --allow-net --allow-read web/main.js
   ```

7. Install Vite:
   ```sh
   npm install -g vite
   ```

8. Run the project using Vite:
   ```sh
   vite
   ```

9. Deploy the project on Vercel:
   - Create a `vercel.json` file in the root directory with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "builds": [
         { "src": "web/main.js", "use": "@vercel/node" }
       ],
       "routes": [
         { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "web/main.js" }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Install Vercel CLI:
     ```sh
     npm install -g vercel
     ```
   - Deploy the project:
     ```sh
     vercel
     ```

10. Install Vue.js:
    - Add a script tag to include Vue.js from a CDN in `web/index.html`:
      ```html
      <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2"></script>
      ```

11. Initialize Vue.js app:
    - Create a `div` element with `id="app"` in `web/index.html`:
      ```html
      <div id="app"></div>
      ```

    - Initialize a Vue.js app in `web/main.js`:
      ```javascript
      new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        data: {
          message: 'Hello Vue!'
        }
      });
      ```

## Event-Driven Architecture and Microservices

The project uses an event-driven architecture and microservices approach to ensure modularity and scalability. Each voxel acts as a server, handling its own state and communication with neighboring voxels. The communication is event-driven, allowing for real-time updates and interactions.

### Microservices with Wasm

Microservices are implemented using Wasm modules in the `wasm` directory. Each microservice handles a specific aspect of the game, such as physics, AI, or user interactions. The event-driven architecture allows microservices to communicate with the main voxel server and other microservices by subscribing to relevant events and publishing events as needed.

## Prioritizing Serverless Functions

### Benefits of Serverless Functions

- Scalability: Serverless functions automatically scale with the number of requests, ensuring that the application can handle high traffic without manual intervention.
- Cost-efficiency: With serverless functions, you only pay for the actual usage, reducing costs compared to traditional server-based architectures.
- Simplified deployment: Serverless functions can be deployed independently, allowing for faster and more frequent updates.

### Guidelines for Prioritizing Serverless Functions

1. Identify functions that can benefit from serverless architecture, such as those with variable workloads or high scalability requirements.
2. Design functions to be stateless and idempotent, ensuring that they can be executed independently and repeatedly without side effects.
3. Use environment variables and configuration files to manage settings and secrets, avoiding hardcoding sensitive information in the code.
4. Implement proper error handling and logging to ensure that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.
5. Monitor the performance and usage of serverless functions to optimize their efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

## Microfrontend Architecture

The project has been refactored into a microfrontend architecture using Rust (Yew) for microfrontends and Deno for microservices. Each feature (e.g., Navbar, Main Menu, 3D Engine) is a self-contained module.

### Project Structure

The new project structure is as follows:

```
/frontend
  /navbar
    /src
    /static
    /dist
    Cargo.toml
    Dockerfile
  /main-menu
    /src
    /static
    /dist
    Cargo.toml
    Dockerfile
  /3d-engine
    /src
    /static
    /dist
    Cargo.toml
    Dockerfile
/backend
  /auth-service
    server.ts
    deno.json
    import_map.json
    Dockerfile
  /data-service
    server.ts
    deno.json
    import_map.json
    Dockerfile
/gateway
  gateway.ts
  deno.json
  Dockerfile
```

### Container App

A container app or shell is set up to dynamically load microfrontends. You can use either:
- **Iframes** for embedding separate microfrontends into a single layout.
- **Dynamic imports** to load components at runtime.

### Gateway Service

A gateway service is created in `/gateway` to handle API routing. Example routes:
- `/auth` ‚Üí `auth-service`
- `/data` ‚Üí `data-service`.

### Docker Compose

A `docker-compose.yml` file is added to orchestrate and run all services (frontends, backends, and gateway) together.

### Running the Docker Containers

1. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the services:
   - Navbar: `http://localhost:3001`
   - Main Menu: `http://localhost:3002`
   - 3D Engine: `http://localhost:3003`
   - Auth Service: `http://localhost:8001`
   - Data Service: `http://localhost:8002`
   - Gateway: `http://localhost:8000`
